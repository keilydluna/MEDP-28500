<h4>In this class I hope to learn </h4>
<p>
    I hope to not only learn but really understand the fundamentals of web design. 
    I would like to make my website a little silly and cool and the best way to go 
    about that is by truly engaging with the code and getting a good grip of what
    web dev is all about!

</p><br>

<h4>My prior experience with coding</h4>
<p>
I do have prior experience in this coding. I've learned Python basics and I have made
a website before using HTML and CSS. However, this would be my first time hosting a public
website on github so that is pretty exciting.

<h4>My media production superpower</h4>
<p>
I really enjoy making graphic and some short-form content! My main platforms for these 
have been mainly Canva, Capcut, Procreate, and a little bit of Adobe like Photoshop 
and Creative Cloud.
